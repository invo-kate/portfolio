# Hello
### A bit about me
I am naturally curious about the world around me and love puzzling things out. Those traits serve me well when I am consulting with subject matter experts, coding, crafting language for a particular audience or designing layouts and flowcharts.

I began my career as a software developer, but increasingly found myself in project management, analysis, communication and documentation roles.

I bring a diverse skill set with experience in coding, technical writing, documentation and design. This allows me to approach projects from multiple perspectives and deliver innovative, effective solutions.
