# Hello
### A bit about me
I began my career as a software developer, but increasingly found myself in project management, analysis, communication and documentation roles. I bring a diverse skill set with experience in coding, technical writing, documentation and design.  This allows me to approach projects from multiple perspectives and deliver innovative, effective solutions.

### A bit about my portfolio

Much of the work I have done over the past 10 years is propietary and not in the public domain. However, here are some samples that illustrate the variety of the projects I have been involved with.

| Document | Documentation Type | Tools Used | Comments |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| [Online Platform Hotfix](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/release-notes/online-platform-hotfix.md) | Release Notes | Markdown | Internal hotfix release notes I wrote while I working on the web development team at Security Service Federal Credit Union. |
| [How To Install VS Code on a Chromebook](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/how-tos/install-vscode-on-chromebook.md) | How-to | Markdown | A how-to guide I created when I wanted to use my Chromebook for development. |
| [Chocolate Manufacuring Training Guide](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/training-guides/(https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/training-guides/Cargill-training-excerpts.pdf) | Training Guide | MS Word | Excerpts from training material I created while contracted by Cargill Cocoa and Chocolate North America. |
| [Android Traffic App UI Design](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/images/design/traffic-app-ui.png) | Graphic Design | Photoshop<br> Illustrator | I built a traffic app in Android using a free WI DOT API. Overall, I like the design I created for the UI. Things I would change:<br>1. The yellow traffic light does not have enough contrast.<br>2. The red/green/yellow traffic lights may be challenging for colorblind users, so it would be better to try and find a way to emphasize the +/- travel times to indicate any delays. |
| [T-shirt Design: Roll Mobile and Ascedia](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/images/design/ascedia-roll-tshirt-design.png) | Graphic Design | Photoshop<br> Illustrator | When I worked at Roll Mobile they held a T-shirt design contest. The requirements were to include both the Roll Mobile logo and the parent company, Ascedia, logo. I still love the color palette and how the design turned out. I do think some of the lines should be thicker in order to work for T-shirt printing. |
