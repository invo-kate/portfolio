# Hello
### A bit about me
I began my career as a software developer, but increasingly found myself in project management, analysis, communication and documentation roles. I bring a diverse skill set with experience in coding, technical writing, documentation and design.  This allows me to approach projects from multiple perspectives and deliver innovative, effective solutions.

### A bit about my portfolio

Much of the work I have done over the past 10 years is propietary and not in the public domain. However, here are some samples that illustrate the variety of the projects I have been involved with.
