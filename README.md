# Hello
### A bit about me
I began my career as a software developer, but increasingly found myself in project management, analysis, communication and documentation roles. I bring a diverse skill set with experience in coding, technical writing, documentation and design.  This allows me to approach projects from multiple perspectives and deliver innovative, effective solutions.

### A bit about my portfolio

Much of the work I have done over the past 10 years is propietary and not in the public domain. However, here are some samples that illustrate the variety of the projects I have been involved with. 
* My Markdown samples follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
* My Cargill samples follow the Cargill style and branding guidelines.

| Document | Documentation Type | Tools Used | Comments |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| [Valusin Ring Light Manual](https://invo-kate.github.io/valusin-ring-light/) | Product Manual |  DITA / Oxygen | A project I created as a part of learning DITA and trialing the Oxygen Authoring tool. In addition to the [product manual link](https://invo-kate.github.io/valusin-ring-light/), if you want to view the DITA source files, you can find them here: [DITA source files](https://github.com/invo-kate/valusin-ring-light/tree/main/source-files). |
| [Online Platform Hotfix](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/release-notes/online-platform-internal-hotfix.md) | Release Notes | Markdown | Internal hotfix release notes I wrote while I working on the web development team at Security Service Federal Credit Union. |
| [How To Install VS Code on a Chromebook](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/how-tos/install-vscode-on-chromebook.md) | How-to | Markdown | A how-to guide I created when I wanted to use my Chromebook for development. |
| [Chocolate Manufacuring Training Guide](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/training-guides/Cargill-training-excerpts.pdf) | Training Guide | MS Word | Excerpts from training material I created while contracted by Cargill Cocoa and Chocolate North America. The most challenging aspect of this project was having to repurpose graphics from other Cargill source material, with only MS Paint available as an editing tool. |
| [Android Traffic App UI Design](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/images/design/traffic-app-ui.png) | Graphic Design | Photoshop<br> Illustrator | I built a traffic app in Android using a free WI DOT API. Overall, I like the design I created for the UI. Things I would change:<br>1. The yellow traffic light does not have enough contrast.<br>2. The red/green/yellow traffic lights may be challenging for colorblind users, so it would be better to try and find a way to emphasize the +/- travel times to indicate any delays. |
| [T-shirt Design: Roll Mobile and Ascedia](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/images/design/ascedia-roll-tshirt-design.png) | Graphic Design | Photoshop<br> Illustrator | When I worked at Roll Mobile they held a T-shirt design contest. The requirements were to include both the Roll Mobile logo and the parent company, Ascedia, logo. I still love the color palette and how the design turned out. I do think some of the lines should be thicker in order to work for T-shirt printing. |
