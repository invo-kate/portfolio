# Hello
### A bit about me
I began my career as a software developer, but increasingly found myself in project management, analysis, communication and documentation roles. I bring a diverse skill set with experience in coding, technical writing, documentation and design.  This allows me to approach projects from multiple perspectives and deliver innovative, effective solutions.

### A bit about my portfolio

Much of the work I have done over the past 10 years is propietary and not in the public domain. However, here are some samples that illustrate the variety of the projects I have been involved with.

| Document | Documentation Type | Tools Used | Challenges or Improvements |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| [Online Platform Hotfix](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/release-notes/online-platform-hotfix.md) | Release Notes | Markdown | -------- |

| [Chocolate Manufacuring Training Guide Excerpts](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/how-tos/install-vscode-on-chromebook.md) | Training Guide | MS Word | -------- |
| [Android Traffic App UI Design](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/images/design/traffic-app-ui.png) | Graphic Design | Photoshop<br> Illustrator | I built a traffic app in Android using a free WI DOT API, and overall I really liked the design I created for the UI. Things I would change:<br><br>1. The yellow traffic light does not have enough contrast.<br>2. Also, I realize the red/green/yellow traffic lights may be challenging for colorblind users, so it would be better to try and find a way to emphasize the +/- travel times to indicate any delays. |
| [T-shirt Design: Roll Mobile and Ascedia](https://github.com/invo-kate/portfolio/blob/main/images/design/ascedia-roll-tshirt-design.png) | Graphic Design | Photoshop<br> Illustrator | -------- |
